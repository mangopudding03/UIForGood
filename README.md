# Code for Good

For my project idea, I chose to create a UI to help people battling with mental health issues. Because mental health is pretty broad, i chose to narrow the purpose down to depression, specifically stress-induced and anxious depression. The main goal was to bring smiles onto peoples faces and foster a sense of belongingness and comfort even when going theough rough patches in life. Mental health issues, depression in specific, is a spectrum and not everyone is the same, not everyone have the coping mechanisms and ,most importantly, not everyones experiences are the same. Most designs usually tend to cater to the 80%, because you can't make everybody happy with your UI, but through successful implementation of this application, this UI would cater to the 100%, aka everybody at any stages in life.

When creating this UI, I wanted it the functionalities to be straight forward and easy to navigate with colors that are positive, bright and reassuring. I implemented a animated character, Max, heavily inspired by the healthcare robot, Baymax, from Big Hero 6. Max would go through your photo library, pick 10-20 photos and shuffle them on loop. Through simple animation, silent gestures and a big warm smile, Max's whole purpose is to help the user reminisce good memories and also serve as a reminder that there are people who love and care about them. When going through depression, it's very easy to fall in but incredibly hard to climb back up. Through this feature, it battles with the depressive thoughts and feelings very early on by reminding the user that there is more to life and gives them comfort in their memories. This way, users can recognize patterns and make a shift to improve their mental health and wellness. 

The user can find communities near them on the communities tab , which would give them a list of resources and communities available to them. Based on the community description and their own personal preferences, they can follow the address and take a step into self improvement. All the communities are in person which is significantly better for users to build connections, have engagement, and foster a sense of community through each of their experiences. Most of the communities highlighted in the community tab is open to all and is interactive, so the user can drag a friend along with them and make it into a bonding experience. During stressful times or moments, in order to not fall into the black hole of thoughts, on the Relax tab, there are some breathing exercises, box-method, 54321, etc. , and helpful coping mechanism tutorials. I wanted the videos to be short and straight to the point so that users can take 5-10 minutes and feel an instant sense of relief. If not that, then the games tab has a collection of visually appealing and mentally stimulating games that are a great way to divert their mind and take the edge off things. I found out that games have proven to increase the size of a persons hippocampus and some easy going puzzle games help users reduce depression and helps manage anxiety and mood levels. These two tabs are definitely helpful in providing support when the user is alone which can help them tackle short bursts of depression and regulate their emotions.

Because this project was supposed to be short and required a basic UI design that would be helpful, I found it a bit hard to understand the scope of the project. Some of my early sketches were a representation of my thought process and ideas on the functionalities to include/ not include. Through a couple iterations , I wanted to extend the scope because the more features abailable the better it would be for the user. Some of my ideas were not fully implemented because of time and resources but I want to continue developing it. were some ideas I really liked like the chat feature and find friends feature so that the users can build stronger friendships with one another. But then I realized the possibility of doing more harm than good if the user has no friends. I also felt like there are so many modes of communication, I do not need to add another one but instead focus on creating a one stop shop type of application that would actively help the user improve themselves instead of relying on people to make them feel happy. The games tab and the relaxation tabs were my last minute integrations as just having the community tab felt like it did not have as much impact as I wanted it to have. The animation was something that I felt would have a lasting emotional impact that could drive the users to improve their mental health and wellness from within. 

## How the UI Works
The UI of this application is pretty easy and straightforward. In the beginning, Max would take 10-20 photos and loops them on the left and ride side. For the intent and purpose of this application, I used stock images but it is more personable to the user. The animation and slideshow adds more so an emotional touch to the UI, Max looks at the left image and right image and gives you a warm smile, kind of like "Hey look, remember this when you won the race?" or "Hey look, your family photo at Christmas."

User has three options: 
1. Play a game

2. Find a community that resonates with you

3. Watch a quick tutorial to regulate emotions and battle depression

## Future Implementation
Some of the future implementation of this UI would more so be on the functionality side of it. 
1. I want to implement a log in page to fully allow the UI to be personable to them
2. I want Max to have the capabilities to recognize images based on expressions and carefully pick out 10-20 images because I would rather Max not pick out a picture that invokes bad emotions like pictures of grades, etc. or unimportant pictures like delivery screenshots. I need Max to analyze the users face, pick out photos where there are people, mix them to have variance and maybe analyze emotions too.
3. Save their game progresses.
4. Add a community forum tab by partnering with the communities so that if the user goes to any of the events, they can be invited to the organizations forum and can communicate their thoughts as well as communicate with others.
5. For the breathing tutorial. maybe it would be beneficial to have a sensor or like a dynamic animated visual that mimics breathing. 
6. Connect them with sponsors online to help them cope with their stress and anxiety.
7. Redesign the UI, possibly work on integrating more dynamic features, fix any underlying visual issues like spacings, padding, etc.
